# School Project - Javascript Frameworks - Todos

## üìù Project Description
 This project was an assignment in the course Javascript Frameworks where the goal was to build a fully functional todo list using React and TypeScript. 

 The app allows users to keep track of tasks they need to complete.
 It displays a list of todos, lets users add new ones, mark them as complete or incomplete, and sort them based on different criteria.
